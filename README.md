# Time and Weather Information Script

This Python script provides an easy way to retrieve and display the current time for various cities, including Berlin, New York, London, Tokyo, and Kathmandu. Additionally, it can fetch weather information using the OpenWeatherMap API. To use the script, simply clone the repository, replace the placeholder for the OpenWeatherMap API key, and run the script. The cities and time zones are customizable, allowing users to tailor the script to their preferences. Acknowledging the use of the OpenWeatherMap API for weather data and leveraging the `pytz` library for time zone handling, this script is a convenient tool for obtaining time and weather details across different locations.
